Today's class focused on Version Control using Git, a distributed version control system
created by Linus Torvalds. We learned how Git helps developers track changes in source code
and manage project versions efficiently.

The differences between Git, GitHub, and GitLab were discussed. Git is a version control tool,
whereas GitHub and GitLab are platforms used to host and manage Git repositories online.
Git SCM was introduced as the official source for downloading Git, where SCM stands for
Source Code Management.

We learned how to create a repository and understood that a repository is essentially a
directory or folder that is tracked by Git. The concept of untracked files was explained,
which refers to files that are present in a directory but not yet added to Git for tracking.

The class also covered the difference between PowerShell and PowerShell ISE, where
PowerShell ISE provides a graphical interface for scripting and command execution.

Basic programming languages such as BASIC, Pascal, and COBOL were discussed to understand
the evolution of programming languages and their historical importance.

We also learned about Margaret Hamilton, a software engineer at NASA, who wrote critical
software code for the Apollo space missions. Her work played a major role in the success
of lunar missions, and she is credited with popularizing the term "Software Engineering."

Finally, we learned how to create and manage a Git repository using commands in Git Bash,
which helps in understanding real-world version control workflows.
